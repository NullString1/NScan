<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
NScan is a simple cross-platform IPv4 and IPv6 port scanner written in Rust, supporting SYN, FIN and Connect scans.

You can scan one address such as `example.com` or `1.1.1.1`, or a CIDR range such as `127.0.0.0/8`. 

You can select just one port to scan `-p 20`, a selection of ports `-p 20,80`, a range of ports `-p 20-25` or any mix of the three `-p 20,80-90,25`.

<!-- USAGE -->

Download the lastest release or compile yourself with `cargo build --release`.

Run `NScan -h` to view the help message
